I am a PhD student in the Applied Math Program at Yale University. I work with [Yuval Kluger](https://medicine.yale.edu/bbs/computational/profile/yuval_kluger/) and [Ronald Coifman](https://cpsc.yale.edu/people/ronald-coifman) on various topics in machine learning. I am particularly interested in principled approaches to likelihood-based generative modeling.
